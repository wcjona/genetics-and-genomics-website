                                    <p> Resolving tissue heterogeneity using single-cell multi-omics Single-cell sequencing has become a turning point 
                                        for cell biologists as it enables profiling of single cells without experimental purifications and provides an 
                                        unbiased view of cells, their regulatory states, and their interactions with neighboring cells through molecular 
                                        cross-talks within intact tissues. Owing to rapid developments in technology such as droplet-based microfluidics 
                                        capable of profiling thousands of single-cells by counting 3end of MRNA transcripts, organism-scale atlases have 
                                        started to detangle transcriptional heterogeneity in cells comprising complex tissues. In my talk, I will share how 
                                        we employed single-cell RNA and ATAC measurements to dissect the regulatory logic underlying acquisition of 
                                        regenerative competence in dermal fibroblasts during skin wound healing. In-house sequencing and bioinformatic 
                                        workflows developed for this project can be repurposed to interrogate cellular and molecular dynamics from complex 
                                        (neural) tissues more broadly and map their response to different perturbations We can't wait to see you all on 
                                        Thursday!

                                    <p> Same-same or totally different? Assessing variability among conifer species in the genomic basis of adaptation 
                                        to climate Tree species living in temperate or boreal environments often have distributions that span an 
                                        enormous range of climatic conditions, and populations from different environments are often adapted to their 
                                        local climate. Transplantation of a tree from one extreme of the climatic range to another typically greatly 
                                        reduces growth and potentially causes mortality. How do trees adapt to these variable environments? Does each 
                                        species find some new way to cope with climatic stress, or do the same strategies get used over and over again? 
                                        Answering this question can tell us more about how evolution works, and whether constraints limit the diversity 
                                        of viable solutions that can be evolved to a given problem. Here, review the results from a series of projects 
                                        using exome-capture sequencing to study patterns of genomic variation and association with climate, comparing 
                                        patterns across lodgepole pine, interior spruce, anda number of other species. We identify 47 genes with 
                                        significant signatures of convergent local adaptation, where the same gene is has evolved to adapt to climate 
                                        independently in each species. will discuss how genomics can be used to answer a range of questions in 
                                        evolutionary biology. We can't wait to see you all on Thursday!</p>
